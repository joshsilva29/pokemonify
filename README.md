This is the old repository for Pokémonify, a project that helped me become comfortable with web development.
I made a very rudimentary frontend with EJS templates that loaded from Express routes in Node. These templates
were verrrrrry static, and I decided that I needed to redo the website without EJS.

I have very recently deployed a new version of Pokémonify that uses a separate React frontend and Node backend (deployed
on an AWS lambda) here: https://mnfy.me/.
